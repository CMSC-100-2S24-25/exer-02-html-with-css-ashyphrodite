# Github Pages
This portfolio is hosted through Github Pages. To create one like this, you can follow these simple steps:

1. Make sure your landing page file is named `index.html`.
2. Present/push your files to Github.
3. In your reposistory, go to *Settings*, then *Pages*. Then under *Build and Deployment*, to do it the easy way, make sure the source is selected to **Deploy from a branch**. Then select the branch where your files reside--usually in the `main` branch.
4. Click Save.
5. The live page is now accessible at <your-github-username>.github.io/<repository-name>.

# Takeaways
This exercise let me play a bit more with flex boxes. Nothing extraordinary did I gain from it, but it was fun making.
